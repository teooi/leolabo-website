    Leolabo specializes in neuroimaging data analysis. Our current project aims to develop a model using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) that can detect and interpret what an individual is seeing or imagining. Ultimately, we aspire to explore the realm of sleep and visualize images and videos of people's dreams. This project is divided into phases, including object, letter, and face recognition. As a pioneering effort in a new field, this research holds promise for a deeper understanding of the conscious and subconscious mind, how visual information is stored in the brain, and the development of more advanced neural networks and machine learning algorithms.
