  bio: >
    I am in the department of <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/mbb.html">Molecular Biology and Biochemistry</a> at
    <a href="http://www.sfu.ca">Simon Fraser University</a> and hold a Scientist appointment in the <a href="http://www.bcgsc.ca">BC Cancer Genome Sciences Centre</a>.
    I completed my MSc and PhD in bioinformatics at UBC in the laboratory of
    Marco Marra.
    My early research involved the use of massively parallel
    sequencing to identify driver mutations in leukemias and lymphomas
    including histone modifiers such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20081860">EZH2</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21796119">KMT2D</a>.
    My current research focus involves using genome and transcriptome
    sequencing to discover novel drivers in B-cell lymphomas and to
    determine mechanisms that underlie tumour progression and treatment
    resistance.
    I have a general interest in developing methods to identify non-coding
    mutations with regulatory potential from genome-wide data sets and
    error-corrected sequencing strategies and algorithms to identify mutations and copy number from circulating
    tumour DNA (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28874686">ctDNA</a>). Dr. Morin is a Scholar of the <a href="https://www.msfhr.org/">Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research</a>.
