    I am in the department of <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/mbb.html">Molecular Biology and Biochemistry</a> at
    <a href="http://www.sfu.ca">Simon Fraser University</a> and hold a Scientist appointment in the <a href="http://www.bcgsc.ca">BC Cancer Genome Sciences Centre</a>.
    I completed my MSc and PhD in bioinformatics at UBC in the laboratory of
    Marco Marra.
    My early research involved the use of massively parallel
    sequencing to identify driver mutations in leukemias and lymphomas
    including histone modifiers such as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20081860">EZH2</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21796119">KMT2D</a>.
    My current research focus involves using genome and transcriptome
    sequencing to discover novel drivers in B-cell lymphomas and to
    determine mechanisms that underlie tumour progression and treatment
    resistance.
    I have a general interest in developing methods to identify non-coding
    mutations with regulatory potential from genome-wide data sets and
    error-corrected sequencing strategies and algorithms to identify mutations and copy number from circulating
    tumour DNA (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28874686">ctDNA</a>). Dr. Morin is a Scholar of the <a href="https://www.msfhr.org/">Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research</a>.

    B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas have a high frequency of driver structural
    variants, especially those that involve placing the oncogenes MYC, BCL2,
    BCL6, and CCND1 under the control of potent immunoglobulin enhancers.

    Rare aggressive extra-nodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains unresponsive to standard treatments
    and has a poor prognosis. My projects aim to genetically characterize these extra-nodal lymphomas to better understand

    primary DLBCL in the testes and CNS), and understanding biological distinctions that separate these extranodal DLBCLs
    compared to their nodal counterparts, and to examine factors that promote their progression. The other project involves

    I perform various computational analyses to assist in the classification of driver genes within Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.
    By using computational methods designed to recognize recurrently mutated elements, it is possible to identify mutational
    hotspots within genes of interest. Hotspots, or genomic regions that contain a higher density of mutations than would be
    expected, can be recognized by analyzing the linear genomic sequence or the 3D structure of the expressed protein.
    3D structure-based methods can supplement driver gene discovery by identifying regions in the tertiary structure that
    may mediate protein function and cell survival. I employ both types of methods for hotspot identification and driver
    gene discovery.

    My research project focuses on identifying mutations in patients with relapsed Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma; specifically,
    the analysis of liquid biopsies obtained from these patients. As cells undergo apoptosis, apoptotic bodies containing DNA
    are released into the bloodstream, and this DNA is called cell-free DNA. In patients with cancer, a portion of this
    cell-free DNA originates from malignant cells, termed circulating-tumour DNA. Thus, we can obtain tumour genetic material
    simply by obtaining a blood sample (called a liquid biopsy), which is less invasive and significantly cheaper than traditional
    biopsies. Due to the unique nature of liquid biopsies, I am currently developing several pieces of software for analyzing
    and benchmarking existing mutation-calling tools for use with these types of samples. I am applying these tools to samples
    collected from several clinical trials where liquid biopsies are collected after patients are treated. By comparing the
    mutation landscape of these patients prior to and following treatment, we identify mutations enriched following treatment,
    which may contribute to tumour treatment resistance.

    I am an undergraduate student completing a BSc in MBB and joined the laboratory after completing MBB 342.
    My honors project in the Morin lab focuses on the Fc-gamma receptor locus and the relationship between common germline copy number alterations and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
    I am using custom multiplex droplet digital PCR assays to determine the copy number state of five genes in this locus across large cohorts of cases and controls.

    Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) is rapidly becoming adopted as a
    sensitive biomarker for non-invasive monitoring of treatment response
    in many cancer types.
    Stephen's work helped to establish and validate numerous assays for
    quantifying ctDNA in plasma from lymphoma patients based on common hot spot mutations in genes such as EZH2 and STAT6.
    These assays demonstrated prognostic utility of ctDNA in multiple
    <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27166360">clinical trials</a> and helped describe <a href="http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/22/9/2290">patterns of clonal evolution in DLBCL</a>.

    Lymphoma is the most common cancer affecting pet dogs. Kevin used
    genomic techniques to identify mutations involved in lymphomagenesis
    in canine B-cell lymphoma.
    His work identified <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25468570">TRAF3</a> as one of the most commonly mutated genes
    in this cancer. Kevin also studied the potential utility of ctDNA in a
    variety of human cancers using several techniques including the OnTarget system from Boreal Genomics.
    He joined the laboratory full-time after graduating and has since transitioned to law school.

    Arezoo generated and analyzed exome sequence data from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and
    mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) tumours.
    Her thesis project involved a combination of wet-lab work and bioinformatics including a meta-analysis of published and in-house
    exome data to identify new recurrently-mutated genes in MCL. Her discoveries a novel silent mutation hot spot in MAP3K14. She also demonstrated patterns of clonal evolution in relapsed DLBCL.
