- name: Image Classification from fMRI Data
  description: >
    We aim to create a model capable of classifying images from fMRI data. 
    We currently are using OpenNeuro data used in the paper Generic decoding of seen and imagined objects using hierarchical visual features provided by the Kamitani Lab. 
    The dataset includes brainmasks for the various ROIs used in the experiment as well as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and anatomical tissue data from T1 to T2 weighted. 
    The brain masks range from V1-V4 to higher cortices â€“ a total of 22 ROIs were identified using localizer experiments. 
    Brain masks for higher cortices were found using retinoscopy experiments. 
    The lab conducted two main experiments: one on visual stimulation with image presentations and another on visual object imagination.
    We are currently focused on analyzing data from image presentation through visual stimulation. Our work is accessible via Google Colab notebook.
