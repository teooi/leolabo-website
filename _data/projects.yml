- name: Genetic characterization of canine B-cell lymphomas
  description: >
    Cancer is the leading cause of premature death in pet dogs and non-Hodgkin lymphomas are the most common cancer in most dog breeds.
    Unlike human lymphomas with similar histopathology, canine B-cell lymphomas (cBCL) are incurable and exhibit an agressive clinical course.
    We are sequencing cBCLs to identify driver mutations that contribute to this cancer in a variety of dog breeds. 
    We identified TRAF3 as a novel tumour suppressor in cBCL and are pursuing additional candidate genes. 
    We are also exploring plasma from cBCLs to evaluate the utility of ctDNA as a biomarker and non-invasive source of tumour DNA in canine lymphoma.
